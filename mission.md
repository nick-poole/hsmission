Our mission is to inspire and enable the Haitian population to develop a productive future, to help protect their basic human rights on their journey toward making a positive difference in their country's destiny.

Help provide an education to a child who has lost everything. A portion of the profit also goes towards the payment of shipping donated items to the people of Haiti who are in need.

After the devastating earthquake, conditions have become worse for the majority of the population. The Haitian children need excellent quality schools, clean drinking water, and hope for the future. The bulk of the population of Haiti does not have access to potable water. As 80% of all diseases in Haiti are water borne, consequently, death and disease attributable to bad drinking water is rampant in Haiti

Prior to the earthquake, only the wealthy in Port au Prince and in major regional towns had running water. By donating to Haitian sensation mission, you become an integral part of Haiti's recovery process helping us support victims and bring a positive change to the future of Haiti's children.

Haiti still requires strong support from international organizations and donors in order to maintain stability and strive towards development. Working together we can ensure a better outcome for the next generation of Haitians. Something that many of us take for granted each and every day will help provide a better tomorrow for Haiti's children. bx
We will continue to "fight the fight" against poverty and malnutrition so that those defenseless children can once again find hope for a better future. Friends, thank you for helping us heal Haiti and making the world a better place.

## Joseph Altenor Quote

"As a small boy in Haiti, i was inspired by watching my mother care for and cook for homeless people in front of a Catholic Church. From that point on, I've had a passion in my heart to help others, especially the people of Haiti."

"All donations will assist in improving the education for Haitian children as well as aiding in financial need of the less fortunate in the country of Haiti. Haitians have very little but are grateful for all that they have.bxMy wish is for these problems to diminish and for life to be viewed from a different perspective."

Our Mission has adopted a village in Pelerin, Haiti. With your help, we can make a difference in this small village of approximately 2000 residents. We would like to focus on building a Learning Center where the people of Pelerin can learn a trade to help support themselves and their families in the future. your support will help us to give a hand up instead of a hand out.

Another goal of our Mission Team is to make sure each child has a meal during the school day. Approximately 300 children attend school in this village but roughly only 70 can afford the 20 cents it costs to eat lunch daily. We want to guarantee no child goes hungry as long asa we can help.

Haitians have very little but are proud of all they have. you cannot visit Haiti and not be awakened by faith and gratitude of this culture. Whether you visit their country or help from home, Haiti needs our support. Together, We can make a difference.
