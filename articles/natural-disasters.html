								<h2>A Dual Threat</h2>
								<p>
									Haiti is situated along a fault system. This geological feature makes the country
									susceptible to earthquakes. While the region doesn't experience frequent
									earthquakes, when they do occur, they can have devastating consequences. Haiti is
									also positioned in a region known as
									<a
										href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Climate-Change-Resilience%3A-The-case-of-Haiti-Cohen-Singh/ee7c51bf999848c912160d00c6fa948c4e719dc2">
										"Hurricane Alley."
									</a>
									This is a stretch of warm ocean water in the Atlantic Ocean through which hurricanes
									often pass or develop. As a result, the country faces the annual threat of
									hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy rainfall, especially during the hurricane
									season.
								</p>

								<p>
									Given the recurring hurricane threats, many buildings in Haiti are

										constructed to withstand hurricane conditions rather than earthquakes.
									</a>
									This often involves using materials and designs that can resist strong winds and
									heavy rains. Unfortunately, this focus on hurricane resistance can result in
									buildings that are less earthquake-resistant.

								<h2>A Way of Life Destroyed</h2>
								<p>
									The earthquake wiped out many of the country's essential services. Access to food,
									clean water, electricity, and medical care became scarce commodities in the
									aftermath. Supermarkets were reduced to rubble, making it difficult for survivors to
									find nourishment.
									<a href="wells-to-wellness.html">Water sources were contaminated</a>
									, posing a severe risk of waterborne diseases. The power grid was in shambles,
									plunging the nation into darkness. Hospitals and clinics were overwhelmed, with many
									forced to operate in makeshift outdoor facilities. The earthquake not only shattered
									buildings but also disrupted the lifelines of daily existence, leaving the Haitian
									people facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

								<h2>Back to Square One</h2>

									Thousands became homeless overnight, and many were left with no choice but to resort
									to living in makeshift tents. The earthquake had not only shattered buildings but
									also disrupted the lives of countless Haitians, forcing them to adapt to a new
									reality of uncertainty and struggle. The tent cities that sprang up in the aftermath
									became a symbol of both resilience and the urgent need for assistance. Haiti's

								<h2>Relentless Challenges</h2>
								<p>
									Despite the resilience of the Haitian people, the nation has faced relentless

									Matthew in 2016, dealt crippling blows to an already fragile infrastructure. Roads
									were damaged, making the distribution of aid even more challenging. Schools and
									educational institutions were disrupted, impacting the future of the country's
									youth. Moreover, the slow pace of reconstruction left many without permanent homes
