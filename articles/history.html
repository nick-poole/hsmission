									Haiti, nestled within the azure waters of the Caribbean, is far more than its
									picturesque beaches and vibrant culture. It's history is a tumultuous tapestry woven
									with the threads of indigenous legacies, brutal colonization, revolutions, and
									rebirths. A land that bore the weight of chains only to break free and proclaim its
									sovereignty, Haiti stands as a testament to resilience, defiance, and the
									indomitable spirit of its people. However, beneath its surface lies a chronicle
									riddled with pain, suppression, and the echoes of a past many choose to overlook.

								<h2>The Shadow of Colonization</h2>

								<p>
									The French colonization of Haiti remains a chilling testament to the inhumane
									extremes of human exploitation. The French subjected enslaved Africans in barbaric
									treatment, unspeakable torture, and agonizingly long work hours in colonies
									plantations. Their sadistic methods served dual purposes: maximizing productivity
									while systematically breaking the spirit of those they enslaved. Death rates on
									these plantations were staggering, leading to a constant influx of new slaves, thus
									ensuring a perpetual cycle of suffering and brutality.

							<div class="article__section-area">
								<h2>Soil Degradation</h2>

								<p>
									The French, fixated on sugarcane and coffee, disrupted Haiti's environmental
									balance. Their ceaseless cultivation and deforestation led to widespread soil
									erosion, turning once fertile lands barren and undermining Haiti's agricultural
									prospects. Today, the shadows of Haiti's soil degradation and deforestation,
									remnants of France's colonial legacy, linger ominously, continuously hindering its
									agricultural advancement and jeopardizing food security. Such a haunting past
									underscores the profound repercussions of colonial exploitation that Haiti grapples
									with in the present.

								<h2>Haiti's Price for Independence</h2>
								<p>
									After Haiti gained its independence in 1804, the country faced intense international
									pressures. By 1825, under threats from France, Haiti conceded to a staggering
									indemnity of initially 150 million francs, later reduced, as compensation to the
									French for the loss of slaves and property. This financial obligation burdened Haiti
									with an immense debt. To service this debt, Haiti had to secure high-interest loans
									that persisted well into the 20th century. This prolonged financial strain
									significantly hampered the nation's economic growth and development.

								<h2>France's Persistent Economic Stranglehold</h2>
								<p>
									Even after the debt was settled, France's economic influence over Haiti persisted.
									The European nation retained significant commercial and economic interests in the
									region. This neocolonial grip, coupled with internal political instability, hindered
									Haiti's efforts to develop self-reliant and sustainable economic policies, leaving
									the nation economically vulnerable.

								<h2>US Occupation</h2>
								<p>
									The US occupation of Haiti, spanning from 1915 to 1934, profoundly shaped the
									nation's political and economic trajectory during the 20th century. Initiated under
									the guise of stabilizing a tumultuous political climate, the American military
									control not only undermined Haiti's sovereignty but also left an indelible mark on
									its socio-economic fabric.
								</p>

								<blockquote>
									Beneath the pretense of order, the U.S. maneuvered Haiti's fate for its own gain.
								</blockquote>

								<p>
									During these years, the US wielded significant influence over Haitian policies,
									favoring American interests and often sidelining the needs and aspirations of the
									Haitian people. This period, marked by external control and internal resistance, has
									left lasting reverberations in the nation's quest for autonomy and prosperity.

								<h2>Diplomatic Neglect</h2>
								<p>
									Haiti's challenges are also intensified by diplomatic isolation and targeted
									sanctions. Notably, the palpable disdain from Caribbean neighbors, particularly
									<a
										href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/world/americas/haiti-dominican-republic-deportation.html">
										the Dominican Republic
									</a>
									, underscores regional tensions. However, the starkest difference in international
									treatment is evident in U.S. immigration policies: while
									<a href="https://guides.loc.gov/latinx-civil-rights/cuban-adjustment-act">
										Cubans have historically been granted a path to residency
									</a>
									, Haitians often

										face rigorous detention and deportation
									</a>
									. Such disparities reveal the biases in global diplomacy, with Haiti bearing the
									brunt of collective neglect. Such disparities in treatment underscore the selective
									compassion and biases deeply rooted in international relations, with Haiti often
									finding itself at the receiving end of the world's neglect and prejudice.

								<h2>Marginalized in the Marketplace</h2>
								<p>
									In the grand theatre of global economics, Haiti has often been relegated to the
									sidelines. Dominated by powerful economies and overshadowed by larger Caribbean and
									Latin American markets, the nation has struggled to secure its rightful place. Such
									systemic oversight isn't merely an abstract misfortune but has tangible
									repercussions: diminished foreign investments, fewer trade opportunities, and
									reduced access to global markets.

										The assassination of President Jovenel Moïse

									rattled Haiti's already fragile state. Beyond the immediate political fallout, the
									event deepened feelings of vulnerability and distrust among its citizens. This
									brazen act rekindled painful memories of past upheavals, reinforcing fears of
									instability. For many Haitians, it's a stark reminder that security remains a
									distant dream, further straining their mental and emotional well-being in an
									environment of perpetual uncertainty.
								</p>

								<h2>A Nation Neglected</h2>

								<p>
									Haiti's struggles have been a mere footnote in global history and is often
									overshadowed by larger geopolitical narratives. But for those who dare to look
									closer, the intricate weave reveals a damning pattern of exploitation, indifference,
									and betrayal. While nations pride themselves on their advancements and global
									contributions, few stop to consider the costs borne by countries like Haiti. The
									world may find it convenient to turn a blind eye, but as the repercussions of past
									injustices continue to ripple through Haiti's present, the global community's
									collective conscience must confront the harsh reality it has long chosen to neglect.
