              Haiti, known then as Saint-Domingue, was a jewel in the crown of the French colonial empire during the
              18th century. Under French rule, the island was turned into a vast sugarcane plantation worked by enslaved
              Africans. The exploitation was brutal, with the colonists demanding intensive labor to maximize profits.
              The combination of forced labor and lucrative sugarcane production made Saint-Domingue the world's richest
              colony, but at a horrifying human cost.

              <p class="article__section-text">The monocultural plantation system, focusing primarily on sugarcane and
                later on coffee, took a heavy toll on the island's environment. Intensive farming practices, paired with
                deforestation to create more arable land, led to severe soil erosion and depletion. Over time, this
                rendered large tracts of land infertile, creating long-term challenges for Haiti's agricultural
                sustainability and food security.</p>

              <p class="article__section-text">After Haiti gained its independence in 1804, the country faced intense
                international pressures. By 1825,
                under threats from France, Haiti conceded to a staggering indemnity of initially 150 million francs,
                later
                reduced, as compensation to the French for the loss of slaves and property. This financial obligation
                burdened Haiti with an immense debt. To service this debt, Haiti had to secure high-interest loans that
                persisted well into the 20th century. This prolonged financial strain significantly hampered the
                nation's
                economic growth and development.</p>
