 
Haiti, a country filled with wonderful and loving people, faces immense challenges due to government oppression and lack of basic necessities. The privilege of living a fundamental life, with access to everyday needs, is not readily available to many Haitians. However, despite their hardships, the people of Haiti are resilient and make the most of any opportunity they receive.

For me, the driving force behind this mission is to make a difference in their lives, to provide them with the chance to experience a basic existence. It is about empowering them to create something meaningful for themselves and their families, allowing them to live a more normal life.

Haiti is a country of extreme wealth disparities, with a significant gap between the rich and the poor. Those who are less fortunate struggle to meet their basic needs, such as food and education. In Haiti, children cannot attend school if they lack the financial means. Consequently, young men in their twenties are still stuck in middle school, as they are repeatedly forced to drop out due to financial constraints. They may only manage to attend school for a few months each year, repeating the same class in subsequent years.

The goal is to provide a sustainable solution that enables individuals to generate income and support themselves, so they no longer have to rely on handouts. Haitians don't seek charity; they simply desire an opportunity to work hard and provide for their families, to pay for their own education. The absence of financial resources should not hinder their access to education or prevent them from securing a meal.

Consider a village we have adopted in Haiti, where a school of 300 to 400 students exists. To receive lunch at school, each student is required to pay $0.70 per day. Sadly, only 70 students can afford this amount, leaving the rest without a meal. Furthermore, there's uncertainty about whether they will have food at home.

These are the stark realities Haitians face â€“ the lack of access to basic human needs that we often take for granted. By supporting our mission, we aim to alleviate these struggles and provide Haitians with the means to live a more dignified life, where they can work hard and support their families, ensuring access to education and daily sustenance.

Our mission is rooted in compassion, understanding, and the belief that every individual deserves a fair chance at a better life. Together, we can make a significant impact and uplift the lives of Haitians, empowering them to create a brighter future for themselves and their communities.
